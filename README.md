1. Download the .rar to get the Unity project.
2. You need libraries. Download them from here and put them inside the project folder: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UZ6i9WGq41hfZl1EEgrpAXCiJltGpRfC/view?usp=sharing
3. I am going to give some indications to use this simulation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting the simulation:
1. Hold right click, move upwards and put the camera above the ground.
2. Hold left shift and scroll forward until a white rectangle appears (it mocks the left hand).

Playing the simulator:
1. Right click will simulate the eyes. Where the player is looking at. Try to move it side to side and up and down.
2. To move in any direction, hold left shift and press W (to go forward), S (to go backwards), A (to go left) and D (to go right).
3. Try to move with WASD and hold right click at the same time.
4. Try to move with WASD and DON'T hold right click to see what does different.
5. Hold left shift and press Q to rotate view to the left.
6. Hold left shift and press E to rotate view to the right.
7. You can try to combine all the moves.
8. If you hold left shift and scroll backwards and forward, it's like you are moving your head in the mentioned directions without
moving yourself from the place.
9. Hold left shift, push the scroll and move it backwards and forward and see what happens.
10. Last point, hold left shift, press right click, push scroll and move it backwards and forward.

I know controls are not that easy to learn, but it's not easy to mock virtual reality without the proper tools either.

I hope you get some useful ideas from here.
